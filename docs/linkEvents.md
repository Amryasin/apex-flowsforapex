## Link Events (New in V5.0)

![link events example](images/linkEvents.png "Link Events Example")

* A Link is a mechanism for connecting two sections of a Process.
* Link Events can be used to avoid long Sequence Flow lines.
* The use of Link Events is limited to a single Process level (i.e., they cannot link a parent Process with a Sub-Process or one pool to another pool).
* There can be multiple source Link Events, but there can only be one target Link Event.
